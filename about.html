			<h2>Jack's Favorite Painting</h2>
			<p>After examining the paintings shown in the gallery, I was able to figure out easily that this one was my favorite. It reminds me of my home, Ann Arbor, where it is often cold snowy throughout one third of the year. It's so enjoyable to look at, and I'm happy we have this painting hanging up in my house!</p>
